# Chase Dooley is studying philosophy and writing essays in Colorado.

I was born and raised in Florida, and in high school, I found that I love to write. In 2016, I moved to Iowa to start college, studying at Drake University; while there, I would discover that I love wisdom. In 2018, I transferred to Colorado, but financial issues caused me to withdraw from school. I spent 2019 figuring out myself: who am I, and what do I want to do with myself? I had my answer: I want to be a philosopher-writer.

I began making changes in July of 2019, trying to bring out my infinite potential. In November of 2019, I started writing essays and publishing them to my website, and in the Spring of 2020, I returned to college. I am studying philosophy at the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs (UCCS), and I plan to go all the way to a Ph.D.
